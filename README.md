# A clothing accessory wishlist

The project for this course is to enhance two static web pages, using all of the JavaScript techniques that you've learnt throughout the course.  The two pages are for a wishlist on a clothing accessories website.  The aim of the site is to allows visitors to view clothing accessories by category (hats, gloves, socks, and sunglasses), filter by color, and then add up to three items to their own wishlist.  The wishlist can then be viewed, and items can be removed from the wishlist.

Currently, the website is just static HTML, CSS, and images; your job is to make these static web pages work dynamically with differen JavaScript techniques.  The static website, which is the project starting point, is attached to the resources tab of this unit.  Download the zip file containing the different HTML and CSS assets, store them all in an appropriate folder for you to work on and have a look at what the two files HTML files look like in Firefox.

The zip file includes an initial git repository; ensure that the repository is set up correctly by running `git status` in the terminal before starting on the project work.  If the repository does not exist, set it up using `git init`.

_It is important to regularly commit the changes that you make in your project using git._  Proof of your git commit history is a required part of your project submission.

Once you have downloaded the files, looked through the HTML and checked the git repository, work through the following tasks to demonstrate the JavaScript techniques that you've learnt.  They don't have to be completed in the order that they are listed, although they are listed in an order that should get progressively more challenging.

_Don't forget that `console.log` can be used to output information in any functions you write.  `console.log` can be very useful to help to identify why something isn't working in your JavaScript code._
